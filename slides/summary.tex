\section{Summary}

\begin{frame}[t,fragile]{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The introduction of initializer in range-based for loops in C++20 
        needs to be complemented with the expression part.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Avoid updates at the end of the loop.
      \item Not using the initialized variable in the expression should not be
            an issue.
    \end{itemize}
  
  \vfill\pause
  \item The use of \cppid{std::views::enumerate} is not a general solution for
        every coding pattern.

  \vfill\pause
  \item Ranges are a great building block, but they do not need to solve every
        problem.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Do not try to enforce a single style of programming [D\&E].
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
