J. Daniel Garcia presenting.
GA: This is a minor thing - but being able to use continue in the middle of ranged for-loops is nice.
Michael Spencer: meets the bar for me
Alan Gray: without this feature this is amazing. This not being in the original specification is a defect.
Pablo Halpern: I ran into this problem yesterday. I wanted to start my index count at 2 and enumerate didn’t work. I hacked around it but it’s annoying. I like this.
GA: the disambiguator is a single colon.

Poll: P3667R0: EWG encourages more work in the direction of extending range-for loop with an expression statement

Consensus

Reasoning? The disambiguator being a single colon is … an issue. We also need a better enumerate.
