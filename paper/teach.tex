\section{Teachability}

This proposal improves teachability of the C++ language as it makes regular for
loops and range-based for loops more uniform improving regularity of the
language.

We can simply teach that a for loop has:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Optionally, a possibly comma-separated list of initializations in an \emph{init-statement}.
  \item Optionally, one of the followings:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A condition.
      \item A \emph{for-range-declaration} separated with colon from a
            \emph{for-range-initialize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item Optionally, an expression.
\end{itemize}

In addition to regularity, this proposal allows to avoid simple errors made by
programmers when using range-based for loops.
